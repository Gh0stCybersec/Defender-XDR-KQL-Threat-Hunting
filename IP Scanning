# IP Scanning on a specific Subnet

## Query Information


### Description
This KQL query aims to detect any machine on the network performing scanning recon scans. 

### Usage
Customise the RemotePortCount to speicific need. As IP scans will typically scan a large number of ports the higher 
the RemotePortCount number the less likely a scan will be detected.

//Query that searches for network scanning tools , Angry IP Scanner and Softperfect Network Scanner
//add more tools,
let RemotePortCount = 100;

//| where Timestamp >= ago(1d)
| where RemoteIP contains "10.0.11"
//Customise below to exclude IT mangment tools such as lansweeper if used regularly
| where DeviceName !contains "lanswe"
| where InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel contains "Medium" or InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel contains "high"
| project Timestamp, ActionType, ReportId, DeviceName, DeviceId, Protocol, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessAccountUpn, RemotePort, LocalPort
